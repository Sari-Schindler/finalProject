                <h1>S&P 500 Gains and Losses Today: Index Tops 5,500 as Powell Touts Inflation Progress</h1>

                <img src="../Images/img1.png" alt="Stock Market" />

                <h2>Market Overview</h2>
                <p>After a slow start to Tuesday's trading session, major U.S. equities indexes rallied in the afternoon.</p>

                <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
                <p>The S&P 500 advanced 0.6% on Tuesday, July 2, 2024, rallying to a record close as Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell touted progress in the battle against inflation.</p>
                <p>Tesla shares soared, leading the S&P 500 for the second straight day after the carmaker topped quarterly delivery forecasts.</p>
                <p>Shares of pharmaceutical firm Incyte dropped following a downgrade from analysts at BMO Capital, who cited concerns about the company's cash position.</p>

                <h2>Details</h2>
                <p>Investors took in Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's positive tone about signs of progress in the fight against inflation. Earlier in the day, the Job Openings and Labor Turnover (JOLTS) survey showed a higher-than-expected number of available positions in the U.S. economy, signaling sustained strength in the labor market.</p>

                <p>Despite dipping into negative territory Tuesday morning, the S&P 500 came on strong to close the session 0.6%, closing above the 5,500 milestone for the first time in its history. The Nasdaq jumped 0.8%, lifting the tech-heavy index to its second consecutive record close. The Dow was up 0.4%.</p>

                <p>Tesla (TSLA) shares drove 10.2% higher, notching a second consecutive day as the top-performing S&P 500 stock. The electric vehicle (EV) maker topped analysts' forecasts with its second-quarter delivery figures. The company also said it will release its next earnings report after the markets close on July 23, which will provide deeper insight into its progress.</p>

                <p>Shares of Paramount Global (PARA) jumped 5.7% amid reports that billionaire Barry Diller is considering an acquisition of the entertainment conglomerate. According to The New York Times, Diller's firm IAC (IAC) signed a nondisclosure agreement with Paramount's controlling shareholder National Amusements, which could be a precursor to acquisition talks. (IAC is the owner of Investopedia parent Dotdash Meredith.) Paramount's negotiations with production firm Skydance Media fizzled out last month.</p>

                <p>ON Semiconductor (ON) shares gained 5.4% after Wells Fargo reiterated its "overweight" rating on the chipmaker's stock. Analysts believe the company is set to turn the corner and post strong revenue and earnings growth. ON's ongoing restructuring plan and strong position in silicon carbide (SiC) chips underpin the firm's bullish outlook.</p>

                <p>Shares of nitrogen fertilizer producer CF Industries (CF) sank 3.5%, marking Tuesday's weakest performance in the S&P 500. In its most recent earnings report released in May, the company reported year-over-year declines in revenue and net earnings. Additionally, natural gas prices have ticked lower over the past week, but they remain well above this spring's lows. Natural gas is a key input in the nitrogen production process.</p>

                <p>Shares of pharmaceutical firm Incyte (INCY) dropped 3.0% after BMO Capital downgraded the stock to "underperform" and reduced its price target. Analysts pointed to Incyte's Dutch auction tender offer completed in May, arguing it has limited the company's capacity to pursue acquisitions. The firm also expressed concerns about Incyte's high levels of research and development spending, highlighting issues related to several previous R&D projects.</p>

                <p>First Solar (FSLR) shares dropped 2.7% after Baird trimmed its price target on the stock. Although analysts believe the solar manufacturer remains well positioned to benefit from increased power demand from artificial intelligence (AI) power centers, they pointed to First Solar's average selling price (ASP) and cost per watt forecasts as reasons behind their more moderate expectations.</p>

                <h1>Gold Shines So Far in 2024 as Central Banks Invest Heavily</h1>

                <img src="../Images/img2.png" alt="Gold Investment" />

                <h2>Market Overview</h2>
                <p>Gold has been one of the best-performing global assets of 2024, with central banks driving significant demand.</p>

                <h2>Key Takeaways</h2>
                <p>Gold has been one of the best-performing global assets of 2024, with central banks propelling much of the demand.</p>
                <p>Global official gold reserves increased by 290 metric tons in the first quarter of the year, the largest first-quarter increase since at least 2000, according to the World Gold Council.</p>
                <p>More North American professional investors reported higher gold allocations in 2023 than in the years right before the pandemic.</p>
                <p>The World Gold Council called gold "a market in search of a catalyst" in its midyear outlook.</p>

                <h2>Details</h2>
                <p>Gold has been one of the best-performing global assets of 2024, with central banks driving significant demand.</p>

                <p>Central banks, led by those in China, Turkey, and India, added more than 1,000 metric tons of gold in both 2022 and 2023, according to World Gold Council's 2024 Central Bank Gold Reserves report published in June, and they haven’t slowed down so far this year.</p>

                <p>Global official gold reserves increased by 290 metric tons in the first quarter of this year, the largest first-quarter increase since at least 2000 and 69% higher than the five-year quarterly average, according to the World Gold Council.</p>

                <p>In May, central banks reported buying 10 metric tons of gold, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other sources.</p>

                <p>What’s more, the 2024 Central Bank Gold Reserves Survey, conducted between February and April, found that 29% of central bank respondents planned to increase their gold reserves over the next 12 months.</p>

                <p>This plan is driven by “a desire to rebalance to a more preferred strategic level of gold holdings, domestic gold production, and financial market concerns including higher crisis risks and rising inflation,” according to the council.</p>

                <h2>North American Professional Investors Raise Allocation</h2>
                <p>Beyond central banks, North American professional investors also have upped their gold holdings and reaped rewards from higher prices. A survey of 525 such investors, in a separate World Gold Council report from late June, found that 85% reported an allocation to some type of gold investment in 2023, compared with 69% in 2018 and 76% in 2019.</p>

                <p>The report didn't include data for 2020 to 2022.</p>

                <p>These professional investors "view gold as an excellent portfolio diversifier and inflation hedge, and agree that it reduces portfolio risk,” the council said.</p>

                <h2>Outlook for Gold in Second Half</h2>
                <p>The spot price of gold has increased 12.7% year-to-date in 2024, ranking it among the top-performing assets. As of Tuesday at 2 p.m. ET, the price of gold was roughly $2,324, about 5% below its all-time high set in May.</p>

                <p>The World Gold Council said in its midyear report released Tuesday that it believes that the current price “broadly reflects consensus expectations for the second half of the year,” but noted a case for the metal to outperform.</p>

                <p>“The global economy, as well as gold, seem to be waiting for a catalyst,” the council said. “For gold, we believe the catalyst could come from falling rates in developed markets, that attract Western investment flows, as well as continued support from global investors looking to hedge bubbling risks amid a complacent equity market and persistent geopolitical tensions.”</p>
